/**
A base `ICommand` implementation that executes other
`ICommand`s asynchronously.

An `AsyncMacroCommand` maintains a list of
closures returning `ICommand` references called *SubCommands*.

When `execute` is called, the `AsyncMacroCommand`
caches a reference to the `INotification` and calls
`nextCommand`.

If there are still *SubCommands's to be executed,
the `nextCommand` method instantiates and calls `execute`
on each of its *SubCommands* in turn. Each *SubCommand* will be passed
a reference to the original `INotification` that was passed to the
`AsyncMacroCommand`'s `execute` method. If the
*SubCommand* to execute is an `IAsyncCommand`, the
next *SubCommand* will not be executed until the previous
`IAsyncCommand` has called its *commandComplete* method.

Unlike `AsyncCommand` and `SimpleCommand`, your subclass
should not override `execute`, but instead, should
override the `initializeAsyncMacroCommand` method,
calling `addSubCommand` once for each *SubCommand*
to be executed.
